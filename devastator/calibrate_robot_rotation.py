"""
Calibrate robot's rotation


>>> from src.robot import Robot
>>> robot = Robot()
>>> robot.spin_cw(0.5)
>>> robot.spin_ccw(0.5)

Over the range of speeds from 0 to 1, say in steps of 0.2, count how long it takes to make say 10-20 turns.
Calculate and plot degrees/second for each rotation speed.
